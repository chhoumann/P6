% The following are them facts.

Using weather data gathered from different cyber physical systems in the form of weather sensors, we have trained and compared several different techniques for time series forecasting.
Our main focus was to show that the transformer would outperform previous state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models.
As can be seen in the \nameref{sec:ExpRes} section, the transformer indeed has the lowest RMSE error compared to the other models on every dataset. 
It is worth noting that the transformer used here deviates slightly from the original transformer model proposed by \citet{AttentionIsAllYouNeed}, as we have removed the decoder and implemented the time embedding module presented by \citet{time2vec}.
