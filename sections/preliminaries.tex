\section{Preliminaries}
Given a cyber-physical system with \textit{N} sensors, each sensor is attributed with a time series.
Each timestamp in each of these time series contains information about \textit{C} features.
A time series of \textit{N} sensors can then be represented as \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C \times T}\).
The time series from the \textit{i}-th sensor is captured by \(x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times T} \).
In addition, \(x_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C}\) captures the time series of \textit{N} sensors at timestamp \textit{t} with \textit{C} features.
Finally, the vector of attributes for the \textit{i}-th sensor at timestamp \textit{t} is represented with \(x_{t}^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{C}\). \cite{cirsteaEnhanceNetPluginNeural2021}
