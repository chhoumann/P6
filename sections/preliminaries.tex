\section{Preliminaries}
Given a cyber-physical system with \textit{N} sensors, each sensor is attributed with a time series.
Each timestamp in each of these time series contains information about \textit{C} attributes.
A time series of \textit{N} sensors can then be represented as \{X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C \times T}}.
