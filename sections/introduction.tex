\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

- General introduction to Cyber Physical Systems.
- General introduction to forecasting, why it's interesting and what it's used for.
- Different algorithms exist for time series forecasting, and what we would like to focus on.

A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a computerized system where real world physical events or mechanisms are monitored or controlled through the application of computer algorithms.
In a CPS, physical and software components work together in different spatial and temporal scales.

In this paper, our goal is to do time series weather forecasting using different machine learning techniques. 
The aim of this paper is to measure the performance of the various approaches for a specific dataset.
% TODO: Specify innovation.

A time series is a sequence of a recorded metric over regular intervals.
Forecasting refers to the future values that this sequence will take.
% TODO: Define time series mathematically.
