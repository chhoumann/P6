\subsection{Statistical models}
For time series forecasting, a common approach is to use statistical analysis models like auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).
ARIMA is a linear statistical analysis model that uses time series data to predict future trends. It comprises two models; The Auto-regression (AR) model which is a model that forecasts a variable using a linear combination of past values of the same variable. The moving average model (MA), which instead of using past values, uses previously forecasted errors (residuals) to make current predictions. 
The final element in the ARIMA model, the I, is the differencing of observations in order to achieve stationarity, which is done to remove trends or seasonality, which will affect the value of the time series at different times. The primary drawback of the ARIMA model is the assumption of linearity in the time series data, which may in fact be non-linear.\cite{HybridArimaAndNN}\cite{ForecastinPrinciplesAndPractice}
