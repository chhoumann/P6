\subsection{Machine learning}
Machine learning can also be used for time series forecasting. 
One such machine learning model is linear regression, which can be used to fit a linear function onto a set of data points.
In time series forecasting, it is used to fit a predictive model to a dataset of observed values over time.
By minimizing the error between the input and target values, linear regression generates the most accurately fitted linear function that estimates the prediction values.
Linear regression is highly explainable due to the semantics of how the model weighs the input features. 
In other words, if the weight of an input feature is negative, then it is inversely proportional to the output. \cite{pooleArtificialIntelligenceFoundations2017}

The primary the drawback of linear regression is the fact that is it assumes linearity between input and prediction values which is rarely the case in the real world.
In addition, due to this linear assumption, linear regression is very sensitive to outliers as these greatly affect the resulting predictive model.
Therefore, predictions may be quite inaccurate in various practical applications. \cite{kumarProfessionalsPointAdvantages2019}
