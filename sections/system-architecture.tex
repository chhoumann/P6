As the purpose of the project is to create a system in which a user should be able to see the weather forecast for a specific area, or more precisely, the temperature forecast, we have developed a system that leverages several models to perform the temperature forecasting. 
The goal is to allow the user to interact with the system in such a way that the user can see the accuracy of the different models. 
On a web page, the user is able to select a city for which they want to predict the temperature. The results are shown both as a graph that displays the predicted value versus the actual value, as well as the specific set of temperatures of that city for a given time period into the future. This is similar to what one may see on regular weather forecasts.

In order to achieve, this we have constructed a pipeline that preprocesses the data, trains our models, and the resulting models are then used to perform the forecasting displayed on a web application. 
Figure \ref{fig:architecture diagram} shows an overview of the architecture of the pipeline.

In section \ref{sec:data loading and preprocessing}, we start by presenting the data loading and preprocessing phase of the system architecture, and we also motivate our interest in the transformer model.
Then, in sections \ref{sec:self-attention mechanism} and \ref{sec:multi-head attention}, we describe preliminary theory about the transformer model; the self-attention mechanism and multi-head attention module. 
Afterwards, in section \ref{sec:time2vec} we introduce the method we use for embedding temporal information into the transformer model. 
In section \ref{sec:training}, we describe our approach to training the models, and how we serialize the formatted data and trained models into the Python \texttt{pickle} format.
Finally, in section \ref{sec:web app}, we introduce the front-end web application where the user is able to make predictions using our trained models using a simple graphical user interface in a web browser.
