Being able to perform accurate time series forecasting has always played a big role for humanity, especially when it comes to predicting the weather. 
Today, the state-of-the-art methods for achieving the best possible results employ machine learning. 
For many years, however, machine and deep learning techniques have had trouble dealing with large datasets. 
More recently, the transformer model has shown great potential handling large datasets in the field of Natural Language Processing.

In this paper, we aim to use a modified version of the transformer model for time series forecasting. 
The original transformer model is indifferent to temporal information. 
Therefore, in order to embed our temporal data, we convert the input data to a vector representation containing both periodic and non-periodic information.
Our experimental results show that the modified transformer outperforms all the benchmark models.

In order to display these results, we present a pipeline consisting of a pre-processing layer, the benchmark models themselves as well as the modified transformer model, and finally a front-end web application where the user can choose a model to use for a prediction.
The pre-processing layer filters and prepares the datasets for use in the models.
Once the desired prediction has been made with the selected model, the result is presented to the user on the front-end web application.
